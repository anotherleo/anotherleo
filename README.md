#### hello world
I'm a **<code>programmer</code>**, currently focused in front-end and JS.  
Curious as a cat, loyal as a dog, architect-minded as a beaver, I don't really know why I'm dressed up in flesh as human: *nature does weird stuff*.  
Enough about my inner zoo, I'm a **<code>full-time student</code>** in Brazil with an internship at university: which means I can eat, pay my rent and my second graduation, buy **<code>coffee</code>** and more courses. Sometimes I can buy **<code>games</code>** and that makes me happy.  

I study and work as my life depends on that -- 'cause it does --, so I became really good with **<code>time management</code>**.  
Passionate about **<code>books</code>** and with an organized mindset, I ended up as undergraduate in **<code>Library Science</code>** and will finish next year!  
... but I have more on my mind than that, so technology screamed at me and I started an undergradution in **<code>Information Security</code>** that'll take three years.  
Meanwhile, I took some courses, like **<code>Administrative Assistant</code>** and **<code>Hardware Operator</code>**.  
Well, I do have my troubles, as everybody has their own: I'm **<code>autistic</code>** and **<code>transgender</code>**, which means I faced a f* hard time growing up until realize what the hell was going on with me. Antagonizing that stereotype of the autistic guy, I'm quite okay with **<code>communication</code>**, but I do need a some time alone within my own world.  
By curiosity, I do a lot of **<code>minor courses and classes</code>** to learn how the world works, like fundamentals of finances, physics, law, philosophy, and goes on...  
... and **<code>English</code>** was one of the things that I learned by myself, but still sucks as you can see here.  
**<code>Programming</code>** isn't exception: but Udemy prices and free YouTube lessons really helps to get started.  

Working a free time everyday, I do meditation and **<code>Kung Fu</code>**, as well **<code>boxing</code>** my punching bag.  
If we weren't in pandemic, you would always find me -- physically speaking -- somewhere at **<code>university</code>**...  
... probably the **<code>library</code>**, nose stuck on a book, where I also did two years of internship.  
Now I work at the **<code>Faculty of Law</code>** doing office tasks.  
I also **<code>teach old people</code>** how to use and deal with tech, they love it!  
With people of my own age, we play a lot of **<code>Dungeons and Dragons</code>** and others RPGs.  
I agree that, if you look close enough, **[<code>everything is interesting</code>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)**.

I live alone and wake up early to spend a bit of my time **[<code>looking at the sky</code>](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8r7W6BAFIu/)** in silence and awe.  
... did I mentioned that I like a lot of **<code>physics and astrophysics</code>** stuff?  
This chaos out there reassures me: we're small bits of nothing, but **<code>we can do better</code>**.  
And dogs, I **<code>love dogs</code>**, they're the best of this world.  
You'll find a lot of **<code>Halestorm</code>** and heavy queens on my playlists.  
Where I live reaches almost 32Â°F in the winter, that's **[<code>Niflheim</code>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niflheim)** to us.

For the future: **<code>full stack developer</code>** and bug hunter of **<code>web vulnerabilities</code>**.  
The near future: **<code>learn well</code>**, do better and build up a portfolio.  
We'll see that along the road: even improvised **<code>a library</code>** to help myself.  
Dreams? **<code>Canada</code>**, but isn't a dream 'cause I'm gonna make it real.  

So that's me,
