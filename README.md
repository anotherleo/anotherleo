#### hello world
I'm a **programmer**, currently focused on front-end.  
Curious as a cat, loyal as a dog, architect-minded as a beaver, I don't really know why I'm dressed up in flesh as human: *nature does weird stuff*.  
Enough about my inner zoo, I'm a **full-time student** in Brazil surviving with the internship at university: which means I can eat, pay my rent and my second graduation, buy **coffee** and more courses. Sometimes I can buy **games** and that makes me happy.  
I study and work as my life depends on that -- 'cause it does --, so I became real good with **time management**.  
Passionate about **books** and with an organized mindset, I ended up with a major in **Library Science**, that ends next year!  
... but I have more on my mind than that, so technology screamed at me and I started a major in **Information Security** that'll take three years.  
Meanwhile, I can't stop doing stuff, so I took some courses, like **Administrative Assistant** and **Hardware Operator**.  
Well, I do have my troubles, as everybody has their own. I'm **autistic** and **transgender**, which means I faced a f* hard time growing up until understand what the hell was going on with me. Antagonizing that steryotype of the autistic guy, I'm quite good with **communication**, but I do need a good time alone within my own world.  
I like meditation and **Tai Chi**, but also to release tension **boxing**.  
If we weren't in pandemic, you would always find me somewhere at FURG, probably the **library**, where I worked two years of internship...  
... now I work at the secretary of the **Faculty of Law**.  
I do a lot of **minor courses and classes** to learn how the world works, like fundamentals of finances, physics, law, philosophy, and this list is loooong...  
... and **English** was one of the things that I learned by myself, and still sucks.  
I live alone and I love to wake up early and spend some of my time **looking at the sky** in silence and awe.  
... did I mentioned that I love physics and astrophysics stuff?  
You'll find a lot of **Halestorm** and heavy queens on my playlists.  
So that's me,  
**hi, I'm Leo Thomas**.
